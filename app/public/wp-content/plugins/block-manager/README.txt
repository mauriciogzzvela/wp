Gutenberg Block Manager by [Connekt](https://connekthq.com) will allow you to manage the activation status of Gutenberg blocks and remove unwanted blocks from the WordPress post editor.

== Description ==

The Gutenberg Block Manager is an intuitive tool for WordPress site admins to _globally_ manage the enabled/disabled state of each block. Disabled blocks will be removed from the block inserter on post edit screens.

### Features

-  **Globally Enable/Disable Blocks** - Unlike the block manager functionality in the Gutenberg editor, this tool will globally enables/disables blocks for all users on your site.
-  **Block Search and Filter** - Quickly locate blocks using the block search functionality in the sidebar.
-  **Filter Hooks** - Use the `gbm_disabled_blocks` filter to control blocks from `functions.php`.
-  **Category Switcher** - Functionality for changing the categories Gutenberg blocks.

### Filters

#### gbm_disabled_blocks

Use the `gbm_disabled_blocks` filter to control blocks via backend code. This makes it easier to control the status of blocks across multiple WordPress environments.

	add_filter('gbm_disabled_blocks', function(){
		return ['core/buttons', 'core/columns', 'core/freeform', 'core/table'];
	});
